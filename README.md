This research project will focus on analyzing and processing datasets collected from the OpenWeather website. It is a source of real-time weather information, providing important information such as time, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and other factors that affect weather forecasts.

The specific research object of the project will focus on applying Machine Learning to improve weather forecast performance. Specifically, machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Neural Networks will be researched and applied to build weather forecast models. The goal is to apply these results to improve the quality and accuracy of weather forecasts.
